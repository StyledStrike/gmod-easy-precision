## Features

This addon was inspired by the *"Move Entity"* feature from [Precision Alignment](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457478322), but without the hassle of opening the menu to create constructs.

- Move a prop to another (or to a place in the world) with just two clicks
- *Reload* key to snap a prop to the grid
- *(Optional)* Snap the cursor to the grid
